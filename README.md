# Python for Everybody Specialization

This repository contains my projects for the [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) on Coursera.

## About the Specialization

The "Python for Everybody" Specialization is a course series taught by the University of Michigan and offered through Coursera. It aims to teach programming and data analysis using Python, with a focus on gathering, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.

## My Journey

I embarked on this learning journey at the start of my second year during the pandemic. With ample free time at hand, I decided to utilize it to enhance my programming skills and understanding of data analysis. completed the code and assignments, which allowed me to learn the basics of python.

## What I Learned

Through this specialization, I gained a foundation in Python programming and data analysis. Some of the topics I learned in this specialization are:

- Basic Python syntax and semantics
- Data structures in Python
- Accessing web data using Python
- Using databases with Python
- Data visualization techniques

## Projects

This repository contains all the projects I worked on as part of this specialization. Each project folder includes the problem statement(sometimes), my solution code..

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the University of Michigan and Coursera for providing this learning opportunity. The knowledge and skills I gained from this specialization have been invaluable in my programming journey.
